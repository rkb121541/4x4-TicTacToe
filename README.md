# 4x4-TicTacToe

This is my implementation of a 4x4 game of tictactoe. I made this by slightly modifying the code for the 3x3 version. I got the idea to do a 4x4 version of tictactoe when one of my friends had this as an assignment for one of his classes.

The most difficult part was making it visually readable. In the 3x3 version, I did not have that issue since I only had to deal with numbers 1-9 for the board positions, so I only had to deal with one digit numbers. With this 4x4 version, I was working with numbers 1-16, so some numbers were one digit and some were two digit. So, I had to modify the aesthetics of the board in order to make sure it was readable by messing around with the spacing and converting the board from a character array to a string array.
